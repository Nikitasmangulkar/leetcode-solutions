/*

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

// Solution :

class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
       StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int n = word1.length();
        int m = word2.length();
        int i=0, j=0;
        while(i<n && j<m){
            sb.append(word1.charAt(i));
            i++;
            sb.append(word2.charAt(j));
            j++;
        }
        while (i < n) {
        sb.append(word1.charAt(i++));
        }

        while (j < m) {
        sb.append(word2.charAt(j++));
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
